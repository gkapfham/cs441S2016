\MYTITLE{Laboratory Assignment Two: Performance Evaluation of File Transfer Using Sockets}
\MYHEADERS{Laboratory Assignment Two}{Due: February 8, 2016}

\section*{Introduction}

As mentioned in a previous laboratory assignment, the ability to implement and evaluate software that supports
communication between a client and a server is a crucial laboratory skill that will support further work in the field of
distributed systems. In this laboratory assignment, you will use several programs that perform client-server
communication through the use of a ``socket'' in the Java programming language. In particular, you will focus on
implementing a program that uses sockets to perform a file transfer on both a single node and two distinct nodes.  You
will also perform an experimental evaluation of the performance of using sockets for client-server file transfer.  Using
either Markdown or the \LaTeX~text formatting language, you will write a scientific report explaining the performance
results that you identified during this assignment. Finally, you will compare your finished file transfer
system to the peer-to-peer systems described in the textbook.

\section*{Review Your Textbook}

Before starting this assignment, you should again read the content in Chapters 1 and 2 of your textbook. As
you did for a previous assignment, please make sure that you focus on the discussion of different types of communication
middleware on page 24. Also, you should review all of the material in Section 2.2, paying particularly close attention
to Figure 2-3 and the description of the interactions between a client and a server. Finally, please make sure that you
read and understand all of the content about decentralized architectures in Section 2.2.2. Students who would like to
learn more about two real-world file transfer systems are encouraged to visit \url{https://www.getsync.com/} and
\url{https://www.dropbox.com/} to learn about BitTorrent Sync and Dropbox, respectively.

\section*{File Transfer through Client-Server Communication}

Since you configured your connection to the ``share'' repository for this course in a previous laboratory assignment,
you should be able to change into the {\tt cs441S2016-share} directory and type the ``{\tt git pull}'' command to gain
access to the two Java classes needed to complete this assignment.

Now, please find the {\tt labs/lab2/} directory in our course's repository and work to study and understand the source
code for the files called {\tt FileSocketClient} and {\tt FileSocketServer}. What are the key aspects of how these two
Java classes support file transfer? For instance, you will notice that these Java classes specify items
like a ``host'' and a ``port'' --- as in the previous laboratory assignment, make sure that you understand the meanings
of these terms. Can you draw a technical diagram that illustrates the general interaction between a client and a server,
customized for these two classes that uses sockets? Please see the instructor if you have questions about these issues.

You and your partner should work together to fully comment all of the source code in these two Java classes, making sure
that you correctly explain how all of the methods and lines of code work. If you consult online references to support
the development of your comments, then please include a reference to those sources in the comments. Once you have
finished compiling these two classes, please run the {\tt FactorizationSocketServer} in one terminal window and then
attempt to have the {\tt FactorizationSocketClient} connect to it. For now, you should run both of these programs on the
same computational node. Once you have gotten the client-server communication to work correctly, record the output of
the client and the server to demonstrate that they are working. If you are interested in exploring this further, please
try to run the client on the computer of one partner and the server on the computer of another. Students should be aware
that, depending on their setup, they may need to enhance these two Java classes to fully support remote communication.

Finally, you will notice that the {\tt FactorizationSocketClient} and {\tt FactorizationSocketServer} have some
``hard-coded'' values in them. For instance, the port on which socket communication takes place can only be defined if a
programmer changes the value in the source code and recompiles the Java class. Since this is not ideal from either a
usability or an experimentation perspective, you and your partner should revise the source code so that it accepts
command-line arguments for any values that you deem to be configurable by the user. While you may use the {\tt args[]}
array to accept these parameters, students are encouraged to consider the use of the JCommander library available at
\url{http://jcommander.org/}. Please see the instructor with questions about this task.

\section*{Evaluating the Performance of File Transfers}

For each of the four ``baseline'' client-server configurations,
you should run the client multiple times to collect many timings and then calculate, at minimum, arithmetic means and
standard deviations. Then, you should run both of the ``useful'' computations (i.e., the one for factorization and the
one that you have implemented with your partner), again collecting multiple timings and calculating arithmetic means and
standard deviations. For this laboratory assignment, you and your partner should focus on benchmarking local
client-server communication on the same computational node. However, teams that wish to potentially earn extra credit
should consider also running their experiments to measure the costs of remote communication.

You and your partner should organize all of your empirical results into tables of data. While not absolutely required,
you may consider preparing graphs of your results using the R language for statistical computation. Next, you should
analyze the results in attempt to find and explain patterns in the data. Overall, what do your results show you about
the cost of performing client-server communication? Once you are finished running these experiments, can you identify
any ways in which you could have improved the performance of the client or the server? Finally, you and your partner
should write a detailed report, using either the Markdown or the \LaTeX~text formatting language, that introduces the
design of your experiment and your research questions, explains how you conducted the experiments, and then presents and
analyzes the results.

\section*{Comparing to Peer-to-Peer File Transfer}

\section*{Summary of the Required Deliverables}

This assignment invites you to submit printed and signed versions of the following deliverables. Additionally,
all of these deliverables must be in the repository that you created for this assignment.

\begin{enumerate}

    \item The well-commented source code of the Java classes that form the two ``useful'' benchmarks,

    \item The well-commented source code of the Java classes for the four ``baseline'' benchmarks.

    \item Using both text and diagrams, a description of client-server communication with sockets.

    \item A detailed paper that reports on the empirical results arising from the use of the benchmarks.

    \item A description of the challenges that you encountered when completing this assignment.

\end{enumerate}

In adherence to the Honor Code, students should complete this assignment on an individual basis. While it is appropriate
for students in this class to have high-level conversations about the assignment, it is necessary to distinguish
carefully between the student who discusses the principles underlying a problem with others and the student who produces
assignments that are identical to, or merely variations on, someone else's work.  With the exception of the provided
source code, deliverables that are otherwise nearly identical to the work of others will be taken as evidence of
violating the \mbox{Honor Code}. This means that, for instance, all of the other comments, source code, data, and
written reports should be the original work of the two members of the partnership. Students who have questions about the
Honor Code and how it applies to this assignment should schedule a meeting with the course instructor before this
assignment's due date.
